          <h2>Valorant Agents and Roles</h2>
          <p>Within the game of Valorant, there are several different agents to choose from with a variety of roles they each play.</p>
          <p>To shortly summarize, you play within a 5 man team where there can be duelists, initiators, controllers, or sentinels. Each character has a unique set of abilities to help the team secure a win.</p>
